First of all, thank you for your interest in the project. This is a simple set of guidelines that you must follow in order to accept 
any changes you made to the source code of the project. Note that this document is still under construction and its content is 
changing.

## General Guidelines
* Always submit your changes as a pull request. 
* You should include a clear list of what you've done in your pull request.
* The framework is composed of a set of libraries. If the change is in one of the libraries, please submit your 
pull request in the repo which corresponds to the library.
* Make sure that you are following the framework's code convention when writing your code.

## Coding Convention
Overall, the framework follows the same convention as Java Programming Language. For sure there are few changes since we are dealing with PHP and not Java. Please follow the following conventions when writing your code:
* Always place your code inside classes.
* Always declare one namespace per file.
* Always place one class per file.
* The name of your .php file should be the same as your class name.
* Use 'camelCase' in your methods names.

## Other rules to follow:

* Always create tests for new features you add before submitting.
