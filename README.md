What is WebFiori Framework?

WebFiori Framework is new web framework which is built using PHP language. The framework is fully object oriented (OOP). It allows the use of the famous model-view-controller (MVC) model but it does not force it.

## Setup

If you plan to test the framework on your local machine, you have to download AMP (Apache, MySQL and PHP) stack first. 
We suggest to use the ones that are offered by Bitnami. You can go to https://bitnami.com/stacks/infrastructure to check 
the available options.

Once downloaded and installed, download the latest release of the framework from https://programmingacademia.com/webfiori/download. 
After downloading, extract all files inside the folder '/htdocs'. The folder will be inside the place where you installed AMP
stack.
