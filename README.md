## Getting Started 

To learn the basics of how to use the framework, please head on to https://webfiori.com/learn. You can also read samedocs docs which can be found in [docs repo](https://github.com/usernane/wf-docs). In addition to that, you can read the API docs of the framework at [the official website](https://webfiori.com/docs).


## Setup

### Local Development Environment

If you plan to test the framework on your local machine, the recomended way is to have AMP stack (Apache, MySQL and PHP). There are many available online. We suggest to use the ones that are offered by Bitnami. You can go to https://bitnami.com/stacks/infrastructure to check  the available options.

After installing AMP stack, you can ethier use composer to install the framework or install it manually by download it throgh https://webfiori.com/download. If you plan to use composer, then you must first download composer from their website: https://getcomposer.org/download/. Once downloaded, place the `.phar` file in the folder `htdocs` or your server root. Once you do that, run the terminal in `htdocs` and run the following command: 

```
php composer.phar create-project --prefer-dist webfiori/app my-site
```
This command will create new folder with the name `my-site` and install the framework inside it.
