## Setup
### Local Development Environment
If you plan to test the framework on your local machine, you have to download AMP (Apache, MySQL and PHP) stack first. 
We suggest to use the ones that are offered by Bitnami. You can go to https://bitnami.com/stacks/infrastructure to check 
the available options.

Once downloaded and installed, download the latest release of the framework from https://programmingacademia.com/webfiori/download. 
After downloading, extract all files inside the folder '/htdocs'. The folder will be inside the place where you installed AMP
stack.
### Hosting on the Web
If you plan to use the framework for all of your domain, then simply upload all framework files to the root folder of your website (usually has the name "public_html"). If you plan to use it in specific part of your website, then upload framework files to the folder that the part of your website will point to.
