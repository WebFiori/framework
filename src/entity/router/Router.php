/**
 * The basic class that is used to route user requests to the correct 
 * location.
 * The developer can use this class to create a readable URIs to system resources. 
 * In general, there are 4 types of routes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>View route.</li>
 * <li>API route.</li>
 * <li>Closure route.</li>
 * <li>Custom route.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * A view route is a route that points to a file which exist inside the directory 
 * '/pages'. They are simply web pages (HTML or PHP).
 * </p>
 * <p>An API route is a route that points to a file which exist inside the 
 * directory '/apis'. This folder usually contains PHP files which extends 
 * the class 'ExtendedWebAPI' or the class 'WebAPI'.
 * </p>
 * <b>
 * A closure route is simply a function that will be executed when the 
 * user visits the URL.
 * </b>
 * <p>
 * A customized route is a route that can point to any file which exist inside 
 * the framework scope. For example, The developer might create a folder 
 * 'my-files' and inside it, he might add 'my-view.html'. Then he can add a route 
 * to it as follows:
 * <pre>
 * Router::other('/test-custom','/my-files/my-view.html');
 * </pre>
